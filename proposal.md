# Capstone Proposal

## Project Description
--A live updating tech news app.

## Problem statement
--Tired of looking on different sites just to get all the tech news you want? Just use this app to see a live feed of all the best tech news out there. can't find that article you wanted to show your friend? use this app instead!

## How will your project solve this problem?
--My app will solve this problem by constantly updating and finding new tech news for the user to browse. My app will accomplish the constant updates by doing a get request when the user scrolls to the top of the feed. if there is anything new the user will see those populate the top of the feed. A user will see a button they can press to save the article they are reading and have it save to a favorites section of the app. They can go back and look at their favorites at any time.

## Map the user experience
--The user will open the app and instantly start browsing the latest in tech news. There will be a button for them to click that allows them to save the current article to their favorites. The user can click the favorites button and will see a list of all their saved articles and be able to read them when they click on the article. Any time the user scrolls to the top of the feed, the app will do another get request to the api and see if there is any new articles to show. 

## What technologies do you plan to use?
--I plan to use React Native for the front end, newsapi.org api for the live feed of tech news, and express, knex, and postgresql for the backend. React native is my unfamiliar technology.
